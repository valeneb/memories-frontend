# Memories | Frontend

"What are you doing for the holidays?"

This question arises every year, and everyone seeks recommendations, especially from close ones. Despite trusting our loved ones, their memory may fade. Hence, the perpetual quest to retrieve travel information.

The idea arose from a realization: there's no app to centralize all travel data, from preparation to post-trip. With the aim of creating such a tool, Memories was born.
